# Cryostasis

## Cryostasis inspired from
**Actual cryostasis tests made on humans
is a project that takes file compression to it's further.**

## Why ?
with the upcoming quantic computing, dehashing SHA256 and +  are gonna be more than theoritically possible
the main goal of this program is to embed files, strings, folders, virtual filesystems through
SHA256 hashing protocol

# Examples :
- GTA5 can game files can be compressed and hashed :
- **Output :**

```


- You can also sign them and have a private password / key to decode or encode properly your desired file
- this ensure security and huge data loads in a 64characters string up to 2⁶⁴ − 1 bits ≈ 1.84 × 10¹⁹ bits
